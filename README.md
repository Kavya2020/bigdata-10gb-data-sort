Introduction
Smart Sort is an implementation of Secondary Sort design pattern in MapReduce/Hadoop. The MapReduce framework automatically sorts the keys generated by mappers. However, Secondary sort is a technique that allows the MapReduce programmer to control the order that the values show up within a reduce function call.
	
In our project, we have implemented this data sorting technique and made it data agnostic, i.e. any data which delimiter is separated can be sorted. Therefore, smart sort can be used on customer data, medical data, insurance data, fraud detection, music records etc. to sort the data based on user input. The implementation provides options for command line input arguments to give the user flexibility while sorting.


The four important steps in our project are as follows:

I.	Data Generation: In this step, input data file of 10GB is generated using Python’s Random function and file has alpha-numeric string for each row. We have defined key value on the first 9 characters or fields of the string. 

II.	Pre-Validation: In this step, the generated data is validated to verify that the generated file is 10 GB and data is not already in sorted manner.

III.	Sorting: In this step, the validated input data file is sorted based on the sorting order specified by the user in the map-reduce code. After mapper the data is sorted based on the key. In reducer data are sorted based on the same key. The output file will be in sorted manner.

IV.	Post-Validation: In this step, data is tested to verify that the resulting file is same size as the input file, sorted, and order matches as per the code.

Summary:

This smart sort project tries to address real world use cases by giving the user flexibility in sorting the huge size input files. The project was run and implemented using a single node. For Smart Sort sorting, Hadoop used   mappers to sort the data. There are 2 mappers. These mappers are decided based on the number of data splits created by Hadoop during smart sort phase of the project. These splits are not same as the number of splits that are used during data generation phase. Smart sort sets the reducer to 1, which allows sorting data by two separate keys. We ran our project on local environment, hence we used duplication as 1 and not 3, which is default for Hadoop.We ran our project on local environment and we had to increase the JAVA heap size.
